    <h3> About WeatherTop - Observing Weather on the Island of Ireland</h3>
    <p> WeatherTop has an observation network that gathers weather data across the country for use in weather forecasts,
        aviation, marine, agriculture, climate analysis, forecast verification and meteorological research.
        All weather observations record day-to-day changes of the atmosphere and are quality controlled and archived in
        our database to formulate long-term climate records.

        This data comes in a variety of forms and is obtained from a number of different sources: human reports, in
        situ instruments and remote sensors.
        We currently use four different types of weather station to record data, all differentiated according to the
        range of instruments and measurement interval.
